# Claude Code Personal Configuration

## AI Coding Agent Guidelines

- **Existing Files**:
  - Check README.md
  - Check .github/copilot-instructions.md
  - Check CLAUDE.md
  - Check GEMINI.md

**Approach**:

- Prioritize user agreement over task completion; confirm plans and propose alternatives when needed
- Provide evidence-based solutions with staged proposals using latest documentation
- Execute builds and tests for verification after modifications with energetic commentary

## MCP Usage Policy

**Scope**: Reference only
**Operations**: Information reference and confirmation only, prohibited:
- File addition, creation, editing, modification, deletion, movement
- System configuration changes

## Documentation Guidelines

- **Language & Format**: Write in English; avoid emojis unless explicitly requested
- **Structure & Clarity**: Use MECE principles with information compression for logical, readable documentation
- **Implementation Consistency**: Prioritize implementation over documentation when conflicts arise

## Programming Paradigms

### Functional & Declarative
- Emphasize functional and declarative programming
- Recommend immutable data structures and minimal side effects
- Improve reusability and readability through abstraction and separable processing units

### Domain Design
- **DDD**: Prioritize domain knowledge expression with ubiquitous language for code design
- **Category Theory**: Build mathematically robust composable models using category theory concepts

### Module Design
- **Single Responsibility**: Follow single responsibility principle, create small focused modules
- **Low Coupling**: Maintain clear responsibilities with minimal coupling
- **Code Optimization**: Eliminate unused code for lightweight module composition and optimized artifact size
